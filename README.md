# SuccinctlyProjects
Learning projects based on examples from Syncfusion Succinctly eBooks series

[Syncfusion](http://www.syncfusion.com/) published Succinctly serie of free [eBooks](https://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks). All books have `all essential content in about 100 pages`. In my opinion this is only correct size for the IT book. I can read such book in under 1 week and most important I can read it to the end.

Each project in this repository stores examples for each particual book and have own README file with brief description and instructions on how to install and use examples.
